## Getting and Running the example
I mainly use macOS for my development environment, but any OS with Go installed should work. First checkout the code:  
`git clone https://github.com/altf2o/blog.git`

Change into the directory and run tidy to get any necessary packages:  
`cd blog/structtags`  
`go mod tidy`

Then run the example:  
`go run .`

## Getting started in Go
If you're new to Go, an easy way to get started is install Go for your platform:  
[https://go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Then get a common editor to develop like VSCode:  
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I would also recommend installing all VSCode Go tools as it makes development very pleasent. In VSCode bring up the command pallet `CMD + SHIFT + P` (on macOS), or `CTRL + SHIFT + P` (on Windows/Linux). Or via `View -> Command Palette`

Then type in: `Go: Install/Update Tools` it'll have several tools, select them all and install them.

With that setup, start learning Go:
